Subject: Application for Front end Intern - Amaar Khan

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Front-end Intern position at Axiom World, as advertised on [Platform where Amaar saw the advertisement -  This information is missing and cannot be added].  As an undergraduate Computer Science student at the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, I possess a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, complemented by practical experience in React.js.

My skills are further enhanced by successful completion of several projects, including the development of a fully autonomous driving agent using Python, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, and various web applications built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript such as a portfolio website and a Spotify clone.  These projects have honed my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces. My internships at TechValley and KP IT Board provided valuable hands-on experience in a professional setting.

I am confident that my skills and enthusiasm align perfectly with the requirements of this internship, and I am eager to contribute to Axiom World's team. My resume, attached for your review, provides further details on my qualifications and accomplishments. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Amaar Khan
